    <h4 style="font-size: 20px; color:#F1C40F; font-family:  Georgia">Mahendra Singh Dhoni, born on July 7, 1981, in
        Ranchi, India, leads a private and relatively low-key personal life. He is married to Sakshi Singh Rawat, whom
        he tied the knot with in 2010. The couple has a daughter named Ziva, who was born in 2015. Dhoni is known for
        his close-knit family and often shares glimpses of his personal life on social media. Despite his immense fame
        and success, Dhoni remains grounded and prefers to keep his personal life away from the public eye, valuing his
        privacy and cherishing quality time with his loved ones. He is also an avid sports enthusiast and enjoys
        activities such as football and motorcycling.
        <br>
        <br>
        He is an animal lover and has a fondness for dogs. In fact, he is known to have a soft spot for his furry
        companions and often shares pictures and videos of them on social media. Dhoni also has a deep passion for
        motorcycles and is an avid collector of bikes. His love for speed and adventure is evident in his collection,
        which includes iconic motorcycles like the Kawasaki Ninja H2 and Confederate Hellcat X132. Despite his busy
        schedule as a cricketer, Dhoni manages to find time for his hobbies and interests, further adding to the
        multi-dimensional persona of this cricketing legend.
